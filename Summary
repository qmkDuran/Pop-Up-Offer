 When you load up the web page an offer appears and you can sign up for the promotion. You can decline with the X in the corner or the option below the email box.
 If you close out than swipe your mouse to the edge of the website the pop up will come back up. 
 If you enter your email you get a thank you and than you close out of the pop up by pressing the X or it closes by itself in 3 seconds. 
 If you put in the wrong email it will tell you that its wrong.
